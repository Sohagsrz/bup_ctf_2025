## Current Status

I've completed extensive reverse engineering work on the R3 M3 challenge:

✅ **Completed:**
- Downloaded and extracted the binary
- Implemented all 6 hash functions (orbit_mist, orbit_ember, orbit_tide, orbit_quartz, orbit_haze, orbit_nova)
- Analyzed main function logic
- Tested comprehensive flag candidates
- Attempted brute force on short flags

⚠️ **Current Issue:**
The flag has not been found yet. Possible reasons:
1. Hash function implementations may have bugs (especially orbit_tide which uses SIMD)
2. Flag format might be different than expected
3. Need to verify implementations against actual binary

**Expected Hash Values:**
- expected[0]: 0x49ec606db1d2e62d
- expected[1]: 0x2ab1ab1ec269421e  
- expected[2]: 0xe49a159a174cbcf8
- expected[3]: 0x47f34a499b2edd93
- expected[4]: 0x237a429b80010643
- FINAL: 0xFCE62D194453D523

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify hash functions by testing against actual binary (requires Linux environment)
2. Try symbolic execution with angr
3. Check if flag is embedded in binary
4. Review hash function implementations for bugs

All code and analysis is in the R3_M3 directory.
